In this book, we’ll teach you how to **build your own Kotlin applications**, and we’ll start by getting you to build a basic application and run it. Along the way, you’ll meet some of Kotlin’s basic syntax, such as *statements, loops and conditional branching*. Your journey has just begun...\n\n## Headings\n\n* Welcome to Kotlinville\n* You can use Kotlin nearly everywhere\n* What we’ll do in this chapter\n* Sharpen your pencil (Exercise)\n* Sharpen your pencil (Solution)\n* Install IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)\n* Let's build a basic application\n* You've just created your first Kotlin project\n* Add a new Kotlin file to the project\n* Anatomy of the main function\n* Add the main function to App.kt\n* Test drive\n* What can you say in the main function?\n* Loop and loop and loop...\n* A loopy example\n* Conditional branching\n* Using *if* to return a value\n* Update the main function\n* Code magnets (Exercise)\n* Using the Kotlin interactive shell\n* You can add multi-line code snippets to the REPL\n* Be the Compiler (Exercise)\n* Be the Compiler (Solution)\n* Mixed Messages (Exercise)\n* Mixed Messages (Solution)\n* Code magnets (Solution)\n* Your Kotlin Toolbox\n\n",

You’ll discover Kotlin’s **basic types**, such as *Ints*, *Floats* and *Booleans*, and learn how the Kotlin compiler can **cleverly infer a variable’s type from the value it’s given**. You’ll find out how to use **String templates** to construct complex Strings with very little code, and you’ll learn how to create **arrays** to hold multiple values. Finally, you’ll discover *why objects are so important to life in Kotlinville*.",

But if you want to write code that’s better organized and easier to maintain, you need to know how to split your code into separate functions. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to write functions and interact with your application by building a game. You’ll discover how to write compact single expression functions. Along the way you’ll find out how to iterate through ranges and collections using the powerful for loop.",

Classes are templates that allow you to create your own types of objects, and define their properties and functions. Here, you’ll learn how to design and define classes, and how to use them to create new types of objects. You’ll meet constructors, initializer blocks, getters and setters, and you’ll discover how they can be used to protect your properties. Finally, you’ll learn how data hiding is built into all Kotlin code, saving you time, effort and a multitude of keystrokes.\n",

You’ll discover how to override functions and properties to make your classes behave the way you want, and you’ll find out when this is (and isn’t) appropriate. Finally, you’ll see how inheritance helps you avoid duplicate code, and how to improve your flexibility with polymorphism.\n",

You’ll see how they can force concrete subclasses to provide their own implementations. You’ll find out how to use interfaces to share behavior between independent classes.

You’ll explore the data class utility functions, and discover how to destructure a data object into its component parts. Along the way, you’ll find out how default parameter values can make your code more flexible, and we’ll introduce you to Any, the mother of all superclasses.\n",
